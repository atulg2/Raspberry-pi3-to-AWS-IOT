# Raspberry-pi3-to-AWS-IOT

A Sample Python script for connecting DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor on Raspberry pi3 to AWS IOT platform (Proof of concept)

The script uses MQTT Library from AWS IOT Python SDK to send and recieve data between pi and AWS IOT platform.

ToDo: Data from AWS IOT platform can be then sent over to DynamoDB (or similiar) through to some visulization layer like AWS QuickSight.
